Traveling Salesperson Problem:
Use MatrixGraph/ListGraph to solve TSP.

Goals:
A: 30 pts - Adjacency List fully working (All the tests passed fine)
B: 30 pts - Adjacency Matrix fully working (All the tests passed fine)
(partially) C: 30 pts TSP algorithm that returns correct results (I wanted to 
				the approach of checking all possible solutions, 
				because I thought it would be easiest, however,
				it does not find the actual length. It does 
				compile, but I have run out of time.)
